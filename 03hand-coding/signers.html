        <h1>Who Were the People </h1>
        <h2>Famous Muscians </h2>
        <p> few names stand out due to their massive historical impact or unique circumstances regarding the instruments itself.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Buddy Bolden</dt>
  <dd>Often credited with inventing jazz around 1900, Bolden defined the cornet as the dominant melody and solo voice in New Orleans jazz.</dd>

  <dt>Louis Armstrong</dt>
  <dd>Louis Armstrong: Starting his career in the early 1920s, Armstrong expanded the solo capabilities of the trumpet and cornet. He moved away from the rough sounds of his predecessors to develop a pure tone that became one of the most imitated styles for decades.</dd>

  <dt>Benny Goodman</dt>
  <dd>Known as the "King of Swing," Goodman made the clarinet a centerpiece of the 1930s swing era.</dd>

  <dt>Muddy Waters</dt>
  <dd>A pioneer of Chicago blues, he was among the first to "electrify" the genre using electric guitars to cut through the noise of bars and nightclubs.</dd>

  <dt>Jimmie Rodgers and The Carters</dt>
  <dd>Discovered in 1927, they popularized the use of the guitar and autoharp in "hillbilly" (early country) music.</dd>

  <dt>Bill Monroe</dt>
  <dd>Known as the "father of bluegrass," Monroe began playing in the early 1900s and made the mandolin an integral part of the high-speed, traditional string band sound.</dd>

  <dt>Niccolo Paganini</dt>
  <dd>In the early 1800s, his "supernatural" speed made the violin a celebrity solo instrument, reportedly leading some to believe he was divinely or diabolically inspired.</dd>

  <dt>Vanessa-Mae</dt>
  <dd>One of the first to merge the violin with techno and pop in the 1990s, breaking into mainstream culture and expanding the instrument's audience.</dd>

  <dt>Yo-Yo Ma</dt>
  <dd>A global ambassador for the cello, Ma popularized the instrument by bridging classical music with folk, jazz, and film scores.</dd>
