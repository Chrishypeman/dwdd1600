        <h1>Declaration of Independece</h1>
        <h2>What is says</h2>
        <p>The Declaration of Independence was designed for multiple audiences: the King, the colonists, and the world.
            It was also designed to multitask. Its goals were to rally the troops, win foreign allies, and to announce
            the creation of a new country. The <strong>introductory sentence</strong> states the Declarations main
            purpose, to explain the colonists right to revolution. In other words, “to declare the causes which impel
            them to the separation.” Congress had to prove the legitimacy of its cause. It had just defied the most
            powerful nation on Earth. It needed to motivate foreign allies to join the fight.</p>

        <h2>Why we are upset</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the early 1770s, more and more colonists became convinced that Parliament intended to take away their
                freedom.</li>
            <li>In fact, the Americans saw a pattern of increasing oppression and corruption happening all around the
                world</li>
        </ol>
